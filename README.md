# Housing-Price-Prediction
The dataset is based on a Kaggle Data Analytics Competition with focus on working with categorical attributes to build an optimal price prediction regression model.

### Tasks Performed for Analysis of Housing Data

##### 1. Numerical and graphical summaries of the housing data set and make any initial comments
##### 2. Fit a logistic regression model which predicts the overall condition (OverallCond) of a house
##### 3. Build a regression model to predict house selling price
##### 4. Use resampling to evaluate the test error associated with the model chosen for prediction
##### 5. Investigated the affect of year the house is built on the selling price of the house
